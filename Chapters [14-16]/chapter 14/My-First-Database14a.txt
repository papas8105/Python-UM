Instructions

If you don't already have it, install the SQLite Browser from http://sqlitebrowser.org/.

Then, create a SQLITE database or use an existing database and create a table in the database called "Ages":

CREATE TABLE Ages ( 
  name VARCHAR(128), 
  age INTEGER
)

Then make sure the table is empty by deleting any rows that you previously inserted, and insert these rows and only these rows with the following commands:

DELETE FROM Ages;
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Ross', 24);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Ula', 17);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Josh', 16);
INSERT INTO Ages (name, age) VALUES ('Mohd', 19);

Once the inserts are done, run the following SQL command:

SELECT hex(name || age) AS X FROM Ages ORDER BY X

Find the first row in the resulting record set and enter the long string that looks like 53656C696E613333.
